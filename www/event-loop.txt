// ~10 Asynchronous lines of code:
function task(){
	var k = 0;
	alert ('Started the task!');
	var text = document.getElementById('textbox1');
	var but1 = document.getElementById('but1');
	but1.addEventListener('click',function (event) {
		alert('button 1 pressed!');
	});
	var id = setTimeout(function(){
		alert('time out!');
	}, 2000);
	
	for(var i=0;i<10000000;i++){
		text.value = i+"'s step";
	}
	alert('finished!');
}
task();

/*
	1)First the k will be initializes with zero.
	2)An alert will be displayed 'Started the task!'.
	3)the input textbox and the button will be searched and found
	  in the document and saved in text and but1 vars.
	4)An event listener will be passed to the according I/O driver
	  in this case the mouse driver to shoot click events
	  Those events will enter a queue outside the flow of the synchronous 
	  code.
	5)A time-out listener will be passed to the driver responsible of time
	  continuum and the last will shoot on time out into the queue outside
	  the flow of the synchronous code.
	6)The for loop will do 10,000,000 iterations changing the value of the 
	  textbox and an alert will be shown 'finished'
	7)Now, after the synchronous code finished the a-sync queue will be dealt
	  with. If the button was pressed before the 2 seconds timer shot,thus registering
	  the click event before the timer into the queue an alert 'button 1 pressed!' 
	  will be shown and then the alert 'time out!' will be shown as well.
		
	  If the button wasn't clicked until the timer ran out of the 2 seconds
	  the time-out event was registered first into the a-sync queue and the 
	  alert 'time out!' will be shown and after that the alert 'button 1 pressed!'
	  will be shown.

	  If the button wasn't clicked only the 'time out!' alert will be shown.

	  Of course, if the button was clicked several times and the 2 seconds 
	  ended between clicks the 'time out!' alert will be between two "blocks"
	  of 'button 1 pressed!' alerts.
