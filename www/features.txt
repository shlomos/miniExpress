Major features of javascript that does not exist in Java:
1. Each variable (primitive or object) can be created dynamically without
   declaring the type, meaning, that it can hold different types during runtime.
   Javascript is also able store different types in one array.
2. Code can be injected at runtime as a string, as opposed to java where all code
   must be compiled first.
3. Javascript supports closures (although Java supports it too, but only in the
   latest version).
4. In javascript there are no classes. If not a primitive any element is an object.
   This object can be modified at anytime, it is possible to add methods and members
   at any stage of the program.
